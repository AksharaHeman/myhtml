    <p>The front end of a website is everything the user either sees or interacts with when they visit the website. It is responsible for the total look and feel of an online experience.Most often, this group will be comprised of a front end developer — whose job it is to actually write the code for the functions of the website — and a UX or UI developer, who will work on the visuals of the website.</p>
    <p>The backend, also called server-side, is the infrastructure that supports the front end and is made up of parts of a piece of software regular users can't see. The backend is basically a website's brain.The backend includes the server that provides data whenever requested, the database where that data is organized, and the application that delivers that information.To turn a new website into a dynamic web application (a website whose content may change depending on what is in its database and that can be changed by user input), you will need to add more backend components.</p>
