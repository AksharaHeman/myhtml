    <h4>Printer</h4>
    <p>In the field of computing, a printer is considered a peripheral device that serves the purpose of creating a permanent representation of text or graphics, usually on paper. While the majority of outputs produced by printers are readable by humans, there are instances where barcode printers have found a utility beyond this traditional use.[1] Different types of printers are available for use, including inkjet printers, thermal printers, laser printers, and 3D printers.</p>
